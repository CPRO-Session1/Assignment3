Answers to questions for Part 2 of Assignment 3

1) It is not valid; for one, variable i is not declared; we would have to assume that it has been declared already. The printf statement is also incrrect, as nothing is actually being printed, which will cause an error.

2) This code will not run as intended, since this is an infinite loop, as it will constantly flip between positive and negative plus being constantly reduced by the .5 multiplier.

3) i) n^2

   ii) (coefficient)n^2 

   iii) 2n
