1. Yes, however i must be declare and initialized before the for loop
2. The for loop is an infinite loop, as i goes negative, and will not ever satisfy the closing condition of the for loop. Also, a semicolon after the foor loop results in it doing nothing.
3.i O(n^2)
3.ii O(n^2) the third loop evaluates to the infinite sum of 1/n^2 in terms of complexity, which converges to approx 1.644. taking 1.644  over infinity results in practically zero, which means the third for loop is called so rarely that it doesn't matter.
3.iii O(n) the two separate for loops run N times, so technically 2n, however we don't care about the integers with big O complexity, so n.
