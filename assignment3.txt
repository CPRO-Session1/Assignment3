1) No the code is not valid do to the printf(). it should be printf("%d",somenumber);. If that is fixed you can assume that the stdio.h is included, 
that it is in the main function, that i is initialized before the for loop, and that it returns 0 then the code should work.

2) the code should work but it is useless. it is and infinite loop the rror in this might be that the i-- should be i++

3)i   O(n^2)
  ii  O(n^3)
  iii O(n)
