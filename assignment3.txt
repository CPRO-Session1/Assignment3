1. The code is not valid, because there is no initialization stated / i is not defined and in the printf statement the name of the variable is missing. 

2. Nothing is wrong with the code in the sense that it will compile, but it is an infinite loop, meaning it will never terminate.

3. 

i. complexity = O(n^2)

ii. complexity = O(n^4) 

iii. complexity = O(2n)
