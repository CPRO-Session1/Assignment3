1. Yes, however i must be declare and initialized before the for loop
2. The for loop is an infinite loop, as i goes negative, and will not ever satisfy the closing condition of the for loop. Also, a semicolon after the foor loop results in it doing nothing, and the i in the code not being initialized.
3.i O(n^2)
3.ii O(n^2) the third loop evaluates to the infinite sum of 1/n^2 in terms of complexity, which converges to approx 1.644. taken over infinity, this is practically zero, so the third function is called so rarely that it doesn't matter.
3.iii O(n)
